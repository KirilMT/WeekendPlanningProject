- This project, `wkndPlanning`, is a web application likely using Flask for the backend (Python) and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.
- Key Python files include:
    - `wkndPlanning/app.py`: Main application file, Flask routes, API endpoints.
    - `wkndPlanning/services/db_utils.py`: Database schema (likely SQLite), connection, and CRUD operations.
    - `wkndPlanning/services/task_assigner.py`: Core logic for assigning tasks to technicians.
    - `wkndPlanning/services/config_manager.py`: Handles application configuration.
- Key frontend files include:
    - `wkndPlanning/templates/manage_mappings.html`: Main UI for managing tasks, technicians, and skills.
    - `wkndPlanning/static/js/manage_mappings_*.js`: JavaScript files for UI interactivity in `manage_mappings.html`.
- The project is undergoing a major transition from a task priority-based system to a technology skill-based system for task assignment.
    - Database changes: `technician_task_assignments.priority` column is removed. Tasks can require multiple skills (many-to-many relationship between tasks and technologies/skills).
    - Task assignment logic in `task_assigner.py` must reflect this skill-based approach. Key considerations: number of technicians needed (`mitarbeiter_pro_aufgabe`), covering all required skills for a task, calculating average skill levels for groups.
- When modifying `db_utils.py`:
    - Clearly state any DDL changes (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`).
    - Ensure functions for managing new relationships (e.g., `task_required_skills`) are robust.
- When modifying `app.py`:
    - API endpoints (e.g., `/api/get_technician_mappings`, `/api/tasks`) should be updated to handle skill data and multi-skill requirements.
    - Ensure data passed to templates or returned by APIs includes necessary skill information.
- When modifying `task_assigner.py`:
    - Focus on the new skill-based assignment logic.
    - Refer to my detailed multi-prompt plan for the step-by-step implementation of skill-based assignment (single skill first, then multi-skill).
    - Group selection criteria: coverage of required skills, highest average skill level per skill, tie-breakers (e.g., workload, technician names).
    - Implement work/time management adjustments: `new_duration = (original_duration * required_technicians) / assigned_technicians`.
- When modifying `manage_mappings.html` and related JavaScript:
    - UI should display tasks based on technician skills.
    - UI should allow managing multiple skills per task.
    - Remove UI elements related to the old numerical task priority system.
    - Ensure UI updates correctly reflect backend data (e.g., skill levels, task assignments).
- For Python code in `wkndPlanning/services/`, strongly prefer class-based structures for new features or refactoring.
- Avoid adding `print()` statements or excessive debugging logs unless specifically requested for temporary debugging. When development is complete, these should be removed.
- When suggesting new JavaScript files for UI components related to `manage_mappings.html`, try to follow the existing pattern, e.g., `manage_mappings_[feature_name].js`.
- The system uses data from an Excel file (e.g., `mitarbeiter_pro_aufgabe`, task duration). Be mindful of how this data integrates with the skill-based system.
